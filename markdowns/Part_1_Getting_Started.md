## 3. Choose data importing options

- `Columns are sparated by` - Select `commas (CSV)`
- **Check** the box next to `Parse cell text into numbers, dates, â€¦`: This allows OpenRefine to **detect the data type of each column**. You can change data types of the columns after you create the project.
- **Uncheck** the box next to `Store blank rows`: This will remove blank rows from the data.
